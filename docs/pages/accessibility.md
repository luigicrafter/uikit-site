# Accessibility

UIkit strives to be an accessible front-end framework by default. In general the overall accessibility of websites and applications built with UIkit still depends on the website's author. If implemented correctly, it should be possible to build websites and applications with UIkit that comply to the [WCAG rules](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/).

## Markup

This documentation provides usage and markup examples of accessible UIkit components.

## Interactive components

UIkitâ€™s interactive components are designed to work with any input devices. By using relevant [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) roles, properties and states, the components should be navigable and operable using assistive technologies, e.g. screen readers.

It's not always possible to determine the precise WAI-ARIA roles and properties that need to be set by a component. Please refer to the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) for further reading.

If you find the documentation or the components lacking accessibility, please open an issue or pull request for the [documentation](https://github.com/uikit/uikit-site) or [UIkit](https://github.com/uikit/uikit) on GitHub.
